          <p>
            An <strong>RCI Registered and Counseling Psychologist, Certified Yoga Practitioner, and Life Coach.</strong> 
            I am a Certified Trauma Expert and I practice Empathy, Self-Compassion, and provide my clients 
            with a <span className="highlight">safe space of non-judgment</span>. 
            I like to deep dive and work with my clients at a personal level to help them 
            discover their true selves that can help them heal their inner child complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach is eclectic, where I customize plans for my clientsâ€™ concerns and 
            their needs whilst using techniques from multiple psychological modalities and 
            Yoga philosophy.
